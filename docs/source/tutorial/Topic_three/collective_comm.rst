Point-to-point Communication 
----------------------------

We have seen a bundle of point to point communication in the previous section. 
Despite the various modes and behaviours of the communication, the basic idea is the same: a message is sent from one process to another.
In this section, we discuss collective communication, which involves multiple processes.
The collective communication can be further divided into: **All to All**, **One to All**, and **All to One** communication.

.. admonition:: Definition

    **All to All** All processes contribute to the result. All processes receive the result.

    **All to One** All processes contribute to the result. One process receives the result.

    **All to One** One process contributes to the result. All processes receive the result.
